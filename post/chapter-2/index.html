<p><strong>Whenever we design something like any website or app, we always concern about different issues like how it will look like, will it be user-friendly, will it fulfill the need of clients? To answer all these questions, I am going to discuss the things which we should check or do before finalizing our design. I think these things can help you to a great extent.</strong></p>

<p>We are living in an era of digitization and websites play an important role in any business. The design of the website has become an important factor to enhance any business. This modern world is changing day by day so the design trends are also changing day by day. It is the responsibility of designers to follow these trends and implement in their design.</p>

<p>If you are just getting started with your new website design then you must be excited. But with the excitement, you must not forget the purpose and objectives. Design plays an important role to make any website attractive and user-friendly, so the designers should take care of these things while designing a website.</p>

<p>First of all, let’s start with the <strong>designing process,</strong> there are different stages in designing process. But there are six major stages in web designing process which are:</p>

<p><img src="/static/website-design-process.png" alt="image here" /></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Planning:</strong> where we determine the goals, and needs of the client and the purpose of the project.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Gather content:</strong> Once we determine the goals, we go for information gathering. Once you have gathered all the content from stakeholders, you can make the description of a project.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Plan structure:</strong> Now it is the time to design and give the look to your imaginations and all the information that is gathered. It is the practical phase in which you come to know that how actually your website will look and feel.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Design:</strong> With the planned structure and gathered information in place, we can start working on the visual brand. Depending on the client, this may already be well-defined, but you might also be defining the visual style from the ground up. Tools like style tiles, moldboards, and element collages can help with this process.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Testing:</strong> At this point, the company and client test the complete functionality of the site to make it error free and smooth in the flow. In this stage, it also looks after that the site should be optimized and gives an excellent review of all the latest and recent versions of browsers.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Live:</strong> Once everything&rsquo;s working good, it&rsquo;s time to plan and execute your site launch. This should include planning both launch timing and communication strategies — i.e., when will you launch and how will you let the world know.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Every project is divided into all the above stages. In these stages, we complete our project but these are not enough for the well-designed website. You are not done with your website until you don’t check your design properly. There are a lot of things, you need to check before finalizing your design.</p>

<p>Here is a list of things <strong>which we should do or check before finalizing our design:</strong></p>

<h2 id="is-it-balanced-or-not">Is it balanced or not?</h2>

<p>The most important thing is balance in your design, your design should balance so that user s can interact with it easily. The human brain finds symmetry attractive, but besides being aesthetically pleasing, a balanced design also has a practical purpose: it helps you establish a hierarchy for your layout and prioritize your content. Avoid the unbalanced elements which distract the users from your design and its message. Symmetry is a great contribution to design A symmetrical design is equally balanced on both sides of a central axis, either vertically, horizontally, or radially. So, make your design is symmetrical and balanced before finalizing your design.</p>

<p><img src="/static/03-adham-dannaway-website-symmetrical-portfolio.jpg" alt="image here" /></p>

<h2 id="does-it-have-good-contrast">Does it have good contrast?</h2>

<p>Contrast is not just a color, as a design tool, contrast can involve shape, scale, typography, or other elements.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons to use contrast in your design, whether for print or web, is to grab attention. You should make sure that the contrast in your design isn’t so dramatic that it’s jarring. Try to use the best effect, best contrasting design elements highlight each other’s differences, but do so in a simple way. Not only is a design looks attractive when contrast is used, but the purpose and organization of the document are many clearers.</p>

<p><img src="/static/Web-UI-Design-for-Human-Eye-1.jpg" alt="image here" /></p>

<h2 id="is-it-accessible">Is it accessible?</h2>

<p>Accessibility is the major part of your design; your design should be accessible so that people with disabilities can also attract with it. For the accessibility, did you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Provide identical content for people with impairments,  whenever possible, or equivalent content in a different format when not?</p></li>

<li><p>Consider visual, aural, and physical impairments?</p></li>

<li><p>Design the site to accommodate adaptive technology?</p></li>

<li><p>Provide alternative access to images, animation, audio, or video that carry information content?</p></li>

<li><p>For ordered lists, use a numbering scheme that conveys the level of each list item?</p></li>

<li><p>Try to structure both data and layout tables so that they make sense when read left to right, top to bottom? If that is impossible, provide an alternative but equivalent page?</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid nested tables?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/static/dostepnosc.jpg" alt="image here" /></p>

<h2 id="is-the-color-scheme-perfect">Is the color scheme perfect?</h2>

<p>Colors have deep significance in design. Designers work with colors on a daily basis, whether designing an app or finding the perfect colors to match a company’s brand message, it is important to good design. Colors have mood effects and cultural significance, so it’s very important to select a suitable color scheme for your design or make sure your use of color, in general, is well thought out.</p>

<p>You should avoid colors that clash badly or using too many colors all at once. When in doubt, using the color palette or color schemes like complementary, analogous can be helpful.</p>

<p><img src="/static/Palette_31.jpg" alt="image here" /></p>

<h2 id="is-your-text-readable">Is your text readable?</h2>

<p>The text of your design should be clear so that everyone can read it and can interact with your design. Size and style are two important things which affect the readability of your text, so you should check these two things:</p>

<p><strong>Size:</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes a font looks much larger on screen than it does print. So make sure your font size is appropriate for your design. For instance, a very large font is impractical for a business card, just in a very small font is impractical for a design that will be viewed at a distance. If possible, print out a proof of your print design or do an online test with your web design to ensure that all your text is easily readable.</p>

<p><img src="/static/readability-lede.jpg" alt="image here" /></p>

<p><strong>Style:</strong></p>

<p>Some fonts are easier to read than others. Simple, clean typefaces are best for body copy. Display fonts are best used and at larger sizes. Save those for when you want a word or phrase to really stand out, rather than using them for paragraphs of text, where they are hard to read.</p>

<h2 id="did-you-use-text-links">Did you use text links?</h2>

<p>Use text links in design whenever possible to make it more clear and simple. Choose text link wording to be concise, precise, and descriptive. One important thing just disables the current link and avoid saying always “click here”. Display link states (available, at rest, active, visited, and current) by using affordances that visitors can recognize.</p>

<p><img src="/static/freebie-psd-dropdown-flat-menu-ui.jpg" alt="image here" /></p>

<h2 id="does-it-have-a-focal-point">Does it have a focal point?</h2>

<p>The focal point means something special in your design which attracts users. It could be an image or graphic, a headline or promotion, or other text. You cannot focus on each part of your design, so you need to decide what’s most important in your design. You can draw attention to this part of your design through size, shape, direction, position, color, texture, or other qualities.</p>
